# stock-analysis
# Module 2- VBA Wall Street

## Overview of Project

### Purpose

The purpose of this project was to refactor the VBA code for the stock data so that Steve can more easily expand and add to the stock data that he wants to analyze. Refactoring the code this way should make it so that the macro not only will be able to run for more stocks than it could initially, but also will run more quickly and more efficiently, providing Steve with the stock analysis that he needs even faster.

## Results

### Stock Performance

Overall, the data shows that the stocks being analyzed here performed better in 2017 than they did in 2018. In 2017, 11 of 12 stocks yielded a positive return, but there were only 2 such stocks in 2018. Also the only stock in 2017 to yield a negative return (TERP) had a relatively small negative return, as it was only the third lowest negative return across both years, 2017 and 2018. The full tables with volumes and returns for these stocks for both 2017 and 2018 are shared in the attached 'Resources' folder for reference.

All in all, it looks like 2017 was the better year for trading the analyzed stock, but there were only 2 stocks that yielded positive returns in both 2017 and 2018, and they both look to be very good options. ENPH and RUN were the only 2 stocks to have positive returns in both years and the only stocks with positive returns in 2018, both returning over 80% in 2018. With such high returns in what was otherwise a down year for the stocks analyzed, ENPH and RUN look like they could be good stock options going forward.

### Execution Times

For the execution times between the two sets of code, the refactored code ran much quicker than the original code. Screenshots of the run times for each year are included in the attached 'Resources' folder for both sets of code. As we can see from the screenshots, the refactored code ran in less than an eighth of a second for each year (0.125 seconds), and the original code took nearly seven tenths of a second for each year (0.7 seconds). With these differences in speeds, the refactored code could likely run for much more data, still in a shorter time than the original code.

## Summary

Although it seems to have been beneficial in this case, refactoring code can have both advantages and disadvantages. As was the case for this project, refactoring code can help a program run more quickly as well as handle larger sets of data more quickly. Refactoring can help code be more efficient and clean, and set up a program to handle similar, more broad situations in the long term, rather than writing code to be set up to analyze one specific dataset.

Some of the disadvantages of refactoring code can include the potential for mistakes to be made while refactoring the code, or the possibility that improvements to the code may not be worth the time it takes to make them. There is also the possibility in large segments of code that changes to one section or one line could have unintended effects on other areas, causing even more refactoring work to be done than was originally thought to be needed.
